# Welcome!
Here you will find further details and resources for exploring data and analysis related to the "A computational framework for indentifying promoter sequences in non-model organisms using RNA-seq datasets" (paper currently in preparation). The [git repo](https://github.com/erinhwilson/promoter-id-from-rnaseq/) contains all instructions for running the code but below you will find static html tutorials as well as links to their corresponding Jupyter Notebooks. We've also provided a data visualization gallery of interactive plots that we hope will enhance a reader's understanding of the data.

## Tutorials
See the following Jupyter Notebooks for tutorials on how various pieces of analysis were carried out:
1. [Exploration of TPM data across conditions](tutorials/tpm-data-exploration.html) [`ipynb`](https://github.com/erinhwilson/promoter-id-from-rnaseq/blob/master/tpm-data-exploration.ipynb)
